# Heart-disease-predictor
This project predicts heart disease from patient data (age, cholesterol, BP, exercise, etc). Data preprocessing and feature engineering were applied, and multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc) were trained. The best model with scaler/columns was saved via pickle file, and a Streamlit app is built for realtime predictions.
